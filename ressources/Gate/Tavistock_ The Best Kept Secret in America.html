I had first hand telephone conversations with retired Navy officer Duane Whitlock before he passed away in which he told me that he was part of the Navy decoding team that deciphered the Japanese code in the late 1930s. He was part of the group that intercepted the Japanese transmissions that indicated their battle group was going to attack Pearl Harbor and he was present when this information was relayed to upper Navy brass. This was at least six weeks before the attack. ">

  <br>
  http://educate-yourself.org/nwo/nwotavistockbestkeptsecret.shtml</p>
  <p>[Editor's Note:&nbsp; No one deserves more credit than <strong>Dr. John Coleman</strong> 
    for bringing to light the history and true purpose of the <a href="http://educate-yourself.org/cn/tavistockarticlesindex04jun04.shtml">City of London's 
      Tavistock Institute</a> and its many subdivisional institutions and organizations 
    which was exposed in stunning detail in his 1992 book, <em><a href="http://educate-yourself.org/cn/johncolemancommof300order14mar05.shtml">Conspirators' Hierachy: 
      The Story of The Cimmittee of 300</a>. </em>Dr Coleman has rightly complained 
    that many NWO expose writers who have followed in his wake, have used his 
    <strong>original research</strong> without crediting him as the originating 
    source and in fairness to him, it should be observed that the information 
    presented below is a reflection of his pioneering investigations into Tavistock. 
  </p>
  <p> The article below was sent to John Quinn by Dr. Byron Weeks. The insidious 
    propaganda and public opinion manipulations (including mind control agendas) 
    orchestrated by London's Tavistock Institute is covered at length in the books 
    of David Icke and Dr John Coleman, but this recent article adds fresh insights 
    and historical perspective. Our thanks to Brice Taylor &lt;brice@teleplex.net&gt; 
    for forwarding...Ken Adachi]&nbsp; 
  </p><p><font size="+1">Preface from John Quinn (NewsHawk)</font>
<br>This forwarded article was received from Byron Weeks; who in our opinion
really has a good firm handle on exactly WHAT is up on many levels with
the extraordinarily extensive "control trips" currently being directed
against the peoples of the world by elements of the global shadow government.
</p><p>Weeks, whom I quoted at length in the book PHOENIX UNDEAD, has sent
us this compelling look at a globally-active British institute which has
had it's hands in just about every social and political/governmental movement
of note throughout much of the world for the past 50 years.
</p><p>For example, ever wonder who and what is "behind", let's say, the CIA?
Well, they don't swear allegiance to America, that's for certain. Try the
British royal family.
</p><p>This report is the real stuff--solidly researched and meticulously documented;
so for lots more truly concept-bending data, read on.

<br>--------------------------
</p><p>TAVISTOCK - THE BEST KEPT SECRET IN AMERICA
</p><p>TAVISTOCK INSTITUTE . . . . . . . . .
<br>30 Tabernacle Street, London EC2A 4DD.--
  </p><p>Formed in 1947, the Tavistock Institute is an independent not-for-profit 
    organization which seeks to combine research in the social sciences with professional 
    practice. Problems of institution-building and organizational design and change 
    are being tackled in all sectors - government, industry and commerce, health 
    and welfare, education, etc. - nationally and internationally, and clients 
    range from multinationals to small community groups. A growth area has been 
    the use of a developmental approach to evaluation of new and experimental 
    programs, particularly in health, education and community development. This 
    has also produced new training events alongside the regular program of group 
    relations conferences. The Institute owns and edits the monthly journal <strong><em>Human 
    Relations</em></strong> (published by Plenum Press) which is now in its 48th 
    year, and has recently launched (in conjunction with Sage Publications) a 
    new journal <em><strong>Evaluation</strong></em>. 
  </p><p>Three elements combine to make the Institute unusual, if not unique:
it has the independence of being entirely self-financing, with no subsidies
from the government or other sources; the action research orientation places
it between, but not in, the worlds of academia and consultancy; and its
range of disciplines include anthropology, economics, organizational behavior,
political science, psychoanalysis, psychology and sociology.
  </p><p>The ideology of <strong>American</strong> <strong>foundations</strong> was 
    created by the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations in London. In 1921, 
    the Duke of Bedford, Marquess of Tavistock, the 11th Duke, gave a building 
    to the Institute to study the effect of shellshock on British soldiers who 
    survived World War I. Its purpose was to establish the "breaking point" of 
    men under stress, under the direction of the British Army Bureau of Psychological 
    Warfare, commanded by <strong>Sir John Rawlings-Reese</strong>. 
  </p><p>Tavistock Institute is headquartered in London. Its prophet, <strong>Sigmond 
    Freud</strong>, settled in Maresfield Gardens when he moved to England. He 
    was given a mansion by Princess Bonaparte. Tavistock's pioneer work in behavioral 
    science along Freudian lines of "controlling" humans established it as the 
    world center of foundation ideology. Its network now extends from the University 
    of Sussex to the U.S. through the Stanford Research Institute, Esalen, MIT, 
    &lt;<a href="http://watch.pair.com/Hudson.html">http://watch.pair.com/Hudson.html</a>&gt;Hudson 
    Institute, &lt;<a href="http://watch.pair.com/heritage.html">http://watch.pair.com/heritage.html</a>&gt;Heritage 
    Foundation, Center of Strategic and International Studies at Georgetown, where 
    State Dept. personal are trained, US Air Force Intelligence, and the Rand 
    and Mitre corporations. The personnel of the corporations are required to 
    undergo indoctrination at one or more of these Tavistock controlled institutions. 
    A network of secret groups, the <b>Mont Pelerin Society</b>, <b>Trilateral 
    Commission</b>, <b>Ditchley Foundation</b>, and the <b>Club of Rome</b> is 
    conduit for instructions to the Tavistock network. 
  </p><p>[Editor, Tim Aho's note: See<i> Watch Unto Prayer</i> report on The
Heritage Foundation founded by <b>Paul Weyrich</b> with funding from <b>Joseph
Coors</b>, who also founded and financed respectively the Moral Majority
and Council for National Policy.]
</p><p>Tavistock Institute developed the mass brain-washing techniques which
were first used experimentally on American prisoners of war in Korea. Its
experiments in crowd control methods have been widely used on the American
public, a surreptitious but nevertheless outrageous assault on human freedom
by modifying individual behavior through topical psychology. A German refugee,
Kurt Lewin, became director of Tavistock in 1932. He came to the U.S. in
1933 as a "refugee", the first of many infiltrators, and set up the Harvard
Psychology Clinic, which originated the propaganda campaign to turn the
American public against Germany and involve us in World War II.
</p><p>In 1938, Roosevelt executed a secret agreement with Churchill which
in effect ceded U.S. sovereignty to England, because it agreed to let Special
Operations Executive control U.S. policies. To implement this agreement,
Roosevelt sent General Donovan to London for indoctrination before setting
up OSS (now the CIA) under the aegis of SOE-SIS. The entire OSS program,
as well as the CIA has always worked on guidelines set up by the Tavistock
Institute.
</p><p>[Editor, Tim Aho: See <i>Watch Unto Prayer </i>report on &lt;<a href="http://watch.pair.com/jbs-cnp.html">http://watch.pair.com/jbs-cnp.html</a>&gt;The
John Birch Society &amp; Council for National Policy for information regarding
CIA operations on the Christian Right.]
</p><p>Tavistock Institute originated the mass civilian bombing raids carried
out by Roosevelt and Churchill purely as a clinical experiment in mass
terror, keeping records of the results as they watched the "guinea pigs"
reacting under "controlled laboratory conditions". All Tavistock and American
foundation techniques have a single goal---<i>to break down the psychological
strength of the individual and render him helpless to oppose the dictators
of the World Order</i>. Any technique which helps to break down the family
unit, and family inculcated principles of religion, honor, patriotism and
sexual behavior, is used by the Tavistock scientists as weapons of crowd
control.
</p><p>The methods of Freudian psychotherapy induce permanent mental illness
in those who undergo this treatment by destabilizing their character. The
victim is then advised to "establish new rituals of personal interaction",
that is, to indulge in brief sexual encounters which actually set the participants
adrift with no stable personal relationships in their lives, destroying
their ability to establish or maintain a family. Tavistock Institute has
developed such power in the U.S. that no one achieves prominence in any
field unless he has been trained in behavioral science at Tavistock or
one of its subsidiaries.
</p><p>Henry Kissinger, whose meteoric rise to power is otherwise inexplicable,
was a German refugee and student of Sir John Rawlings-Reese at SHAEF. Dr.
Peter Bourne, a Tavistock Institute psychologist, picked Jimmy Carter for
President of the U.S. solely because Carter had undergone an intensive
brainwashing program administered by Admiral Hyman Rickover at Annapolis.
The "experiment" in compulsory racial integration in the U.S. was organized
by Ronald Lippert, of the OSS and the American Jewish Congress, and director
of child training at the Commission on Community Relations. The program
was designed to break down the individual's sense of personal knowledge
in his identity, his racial heritage. Through the <b>Stanford Research
Institute</b>, Tavistock controls the National Education Association. The
<b>Institute of Social Research at the National Training Lab</b> brain
washes the leading executives of business and government.<i></i>
</p><p><i>Such is the power of Tavistock that our entire space program was
scrapped for nine years so that the Soviets could catch up. </i>The hiatus
was demanded in an article written by Dr. Anatol Rapport, and was promptly
granted by the government, to the complete mystification of everyone connected
with NASA. <a name="wharton"></a>
</p><p>Another prominent Tavistock operation is the <b>Wharton School
  of Finance, </b>at the University of Pennsylvania. A single common denominator
  identifies the common Tavistock strategy---the use of drugs. The infamous
  MK Ultra program of the CIA, in which unsuspecting CIA officials were given
  LSD, and their reaction studied like "guinea pigs", resulted in several
  deaths.
</p><p>The U.S. Government had to pay millions in damages to the families of
the victims, but the culprits were never indicted. The program originated
when Sandoz AG, a Swiss drug firm, owned by S.G. Warburg Co. of London,
developed Lysergic Acid [LSD]. Roosevelt's advisor, <b>James Paul Warburg</b>,
son of <b>Paul Warburg</b> who wrote the Federal Reserve Act, and nephew
of M<b>ax Warburg</b> who had financed Hitler, set up the &lt;<a href="http://watch.pair.com/FreedomHouse.html#ips">http://watch.pair.com/FreedomHouse.html#ips</a>&gt;Institute
for Policy Studies to promote the drug. The result was the LSD "counter-culture"
of the 1960s, the "student revolution", which was financed by $25 million
from the CIA.
</p><p>One part of MK Ultra was the <b>Human Ecology Fund</b>; the CIA also
paid Dr. Herbert Kelman of Harvard to carry out further experiments on
mind control. In the 1950s, the CIA financed extensive LSD experiments
in Canada. <b>Dr. D. Ewen Cameron</b>, president of the Canadian Psychological
Association, and director of Royal Victorian Hospital, Montreal, received
large payments from the CIA to give 53 patients large doses of LSD and
record their reactions; the patients were drugged into weeks of sleep and
then given electric shock treatments.
</p><p>One victim, the wife of a member of the Canadian Parliament, is now
suing the U.S. companies who provided the drug for the CIA. All the records
of the CIA's drug testing program were ordered destroyed by the head of
MK Ultra. Because all efforts of the Tavistock Institute are directed toward
producing cyclical collapse, the effect of the CIA programs are tragically
apparent. R. Emmett Tyrell Jr., writing in the Washington Post August 20,
1984, cites the "squalid consequences of the 60s radicals in SDS" as resulting
in "the growing rate of illegitimacy, petty lawlessness, drug addiction,
welfare, VD, and mental illness".
</p><p>This is the legacy of the Warburgs and the CIA. Their principal agency,
the<b> Institute for Policy Studies</b>, was funded by James Paul Warburg;
its co-founder was Marcus Raskin, protege of McGeorge Bundy, president
of the Ford Foundation. Bundy had Raskin appointed to the post of President
Kennedy's personal representative on the National Security Council, and
in 1963 funded Students for Democratic Society, through which the CIA operated
the drug culture.
</p><p><u>Today the Tavistock Institute operates a $6 Billion a year network
of Foundations in the U.S., all of it funded by U.S. taxpayers' money</u>.
Ten major institutions are under its direct control, with 400 subsidiaries,
and 3000 other study groups and think tanks which originate many types
of programs to increase the control of the World Order over the American
people. The Stanford Research Institute, adjoining the Hoover Institution,
is a $150 million a year operation with 3300 employees. It carries on program
surveillance for Bechtel, Kaiser, and 400 other companies, and extensive
intelligence operations for the CIA. It is the largest institution on the
West Coast promoting mind control and the behavioral sciences.
</p><p>One of the key agencies as a conduit for secret instructions from Tavistock
is the <b>Ditchley Foundation</b>, founded in 1957. The American branch
of the Ditchley Foundation is run by <b>Cyrus Vance</b>, former Secretary
of State, and director of the Rockefeller Foundation, and <b>Winston Lord</b>,
president of the Council on Foreign Relations.
</p><p>[Editor, Tim Aho's note: The wife of Winston Lord (CFR, Bilderberg,

Board of Freedom House whose manipulation of the Christian Right via the
Religious Persecution issue is documented in our report &lt;<a href="http://watch.pair.com/FreedomHouse.html">http://watch.pair.com/FreedomHouse.html</a>&gt;Freedom
House: A CFR Front.]
</p><p>One of the principal but little known operations of the Rockefeller
Foundation has been its techniques for controlling world agriculture. Its
director, <b>Kenneth Wernimont</b>, set up Rockefeller controlled agricultural
programs throughout Mexico and Latin America. <i>The independent farmer
is a great threat to the World Order, because he produces for himself,
and because his produce can be converted into capital, which gives him
independence</i>. In Soviet Russia, the Bolsheviks believed they had attained
total control over the people; they were dismayed to find their plans threatened
by the stubborn independence of the small farmers, the Kulaks.
</p><p>Stalin ordered the OGPU to seize all food and animals of the Kulaks,
and to starve them out. The Chicago American, February 25, 1935 carried
a front page headline, SIX MILLION PERISH IN SOVIET FAMINE; Peasants' Crops
Seized, They and their Animals Starve. To draw attention from this atrocity,
it was later alleged that the Germans, not the Soviets, had killed six
million people, the number taken from the Chicago American headline by
a Chicago publicist.
</p><p>The Communist Party, the Party of the Peasants and Workers, exterminated
the peasants and enslaved the workers. <i>Many totalitarian regimes have
found the small farmer to be their biggest stumbling block</i>. The French
Reign of Terror was directed, not against the aristocrats, many of whom
were sympathetic to it, but against the small farmers who refused to turn
over their grain to the revolutionary tribunals in exchange for the worthless
assignats. <u>In the United States, the foundations are presently engaged
in the same type of war of extermination against the American farmer.</u>
</p><p>The traditional formula of land plus labor for the farmer has been altered
due to the farmer's need for purchasing power, to buy industrial goods
needed in his farming operations. Because of this need for capital, the
farmer is especially vulnerable to the World Order's manipulation of interest
rates, which is bankrupting him. Just as in the Soviet Union, in the early
1930s, when Stalin ordered the Kulaks to give up their small plots of land
to live and work on the collective farms, the American small farmer faces
the same type of extermination, being forced to give up his small plot
of land to become a hired hand for the big agricultural trusts.<b> The
Brookings Institution </b>and other foundations originated the monetary
programs implemented by the Federal Reserve System to destroy the American
farmer, a replay of the Soviet tragedy in Russia, with one proviso that
the farmer will be allowed to survive if he becomes a slave worker of the
giant trusts.
</p><p>Once the citizen becomes aware of the true role of the foundations,
he can understand the high interest rates, high taxes, the destruction
of the family, the degradation of the churches into forums for revolution,
the subversion of the universities into CIA cesspools of drug addiction,
and the halls of government into sewers of international espionage and
intrigue. The American citizen can now understand why every agent of the
federal government is against him; the alphabet agencies, the FBI, IRS,
CIA and BATF must make war on the citizen in order to carry out the programs
of the foundations.
</p><p>The foundations are in direct violation of their charters, which commit
them to do "charitable" work, because they make no grants which are not
part of a political goal. The charge has been made, and never denied, that
the Heritage-AEI network has at least two KGB moles on its staff. The employment
of professional intelligence operatives as "charitable" workers, as was
done in the Red Cross Mission to Russia in 1917, exposes the sinister political
economic and social goals which the World Order requires the foundations
to achieve through their " bequests ".
</p><p>Not only is this tax fraud, because the foundations are granted tax
exemption solely to do charitable work, but it is criminal syndicalism,
conspiracy to commit offenses against the United States of America, Constitutional
Law 213, Corpus Juris Secundum 16. For the first time, the close interlocking
of the foundation "syndicate" has been revealed by the names of its principle
incorporators---Daniel Coit Gilman, who incorporated the Peabody Fund and
the John Slater Fund, and became an incorporator of the General Education
Board (now the Rockefeller Foundation); Gilman, who also incorporated the
Russell Trust in 1856, later became an incorporator of the Carnegie Institution
with Andrew Dickson White (Russell Trust) and Frederic A. Delano. Delano
also was an original incorporator of the Brookings Institution and the
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
</p><p>Daniel Coit Gilman incorporated the Russell Sage Foundation with Cleveland
H. Dodge of the National City Bank. These foundations incorporators have
been closely linked with the Federal Reserve System, the War Industries
Board of World War I, the OSS of World War II and the CIA. They have also
been closely linked with the American International Corporation, which
was formed to instigate the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia. Delano, an
uncle of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, was on the original Board of Governors
of the Federal Reserve System in 1914. His brother-in-law founded the influential
Washington law firm of Covington and Burling. The Delanos and other ruling
families of the World Order trace their lineage directly back to William
of Orange and the regime which granted the charter of the Bank of England.

of what President Eisenhower called "a possible danger to public policy
that could itself become captive of a scientific-technological elite."
</p><p><b>Brookings Institution</b> Dedicates its work to what it calls a "national
agenda." Wrote President Hoover's program, President Roosevelt's "New Deal",
the Kennedy Administration's "New Frontiers" program (deviation from it
may have cost John F. Kennedy his life), and President Johnson's "Great
Society." Brookings has been telling the United States Government how to
conduct its affairs for the past 70 years and is still doing so.
</p><p><b>Hudson Institute</b> This institution has done more to shape the
way Americans react to political and social events, think, vote and generally
conduct themselves than perhaps any except the BIG FIVE. Hudson specializes
in defense policy research and relations with the USSR. Most of its military
work is classified as SECRET. (One idea during the Vietnam War was to build
a moat around Saigon.) Hudson may be properly classified as one of the
Committee of 300's BRAINWASHING establishments. One of its largest clients
is the U.S. Department of Defense which includes matters of civil defense,
national security, military policy and arms control.
</p><p>[Editor, Tim Aho: This is the same &lt;<a href="http://watch.pair.com/Hudson.html">http://watch.pair.com/Hudson.html</a>&gt;Hudson

1998. This law required the creation of a federal commission to monitor
religion chaired by a presidentially-appointed Ambassador-at-Large on International
Religious Freedom under the mandates of the United Nations' covenants and
authority of the International Criminal Court.]
</p><p><b>National Training Laboratories</b> One of the key institutions established
for this purpose in the United States was the National Training Laboratories
(NTL). Founded in 1947 by members of the Tavistock network in the United
States and located originally on an estate in Bethel, Maine, NTL had as
its explicit purpose the brainwashing of leaders of the government, educational
institutions, and corporate bureaucracies in the Tavistock method, and
then using these "leaders" to either themselves run Tavistock group sessions
in their organizations or to hire other similarly trained group leaders
to do the job. The "nuts and bolts" of the NTL operation revolves around
the particular form of Tavistock degenerate psychology known as "g<i>roup
dynamics</i>," developed by German Tavistock operative Kurt Lewin, who
emigrated to the United States in the 1930s and whose students founded
NTL.
</p><p>In a Lewinite brainwashing group, a number of individuals from varying
backgrounds and personalities, are manipulated by a "group leader" to form
a "consensus" of opinion, achieving a new "group identity." The key to
the process is the creation of a controlled environment, in which stress
is introduced (sometimes called dissonance) to crack an individual's belief
structure. Using the peer pressure of other group members, the individual
is "cracked," and a new personality emerges with new values. The degrading
experience causes the person to deny that any change has taken place. In
that way, an individual is brainwashed without the victim knowing what
has taken place.
</p><p>This method is the same, with some minor modification, used in all so-called
"sensitivity groups" or "T-groups," or in the more extreme rock-drug-sex
counterculture form, "touchy-feely groups," such as the kind popularized
from the 1960s onward by the <b>Esalen Institute</b>, which was set up
with the help of NTL.
</p><p>From the mid-1950s onward, NTL put the majority of the nation's corporate
leaderships through such brainwashing programs, while running similar programs
for the State Department, the Navy, the Department of Education, and other
sections of the federal bureaucracy. There is no firm estimate of the number
of Americans who have been put through this process in last 40 years at
either NTL, or as it is now known the <b>NTL Institute for Applied Behavioral
Sciences</b>, which is based in Rosslyn, Virginia, or its West Coast base
of operations, the <b>Western Training Laboratories in Group Development</b>,
or in various satellite institutions. The most reliable estimate is in
the several millions.
</p><p>One of the groups that went through the NTL mill in the 1950s was the
leadership of the<b> National Education Association</b>, the largest organization
of teachers in the United States. Thus, the NEA's outlook has been "shaped"
by Tavistock, through the NTL. In 1964, the NTL Institute became a direct
part of the NEA, with the NTL setting up "group sessions" for all its affiliates.
With funding from the Department of Education, the NTL Institute drafted
the programs for the training of the nation's primary and secondary school
teachers, and has a hand as well in developing the content of educational
"reforms," including OBE.
</p><p>Also known as the <b>International Institute for Applied Behavioral
Sciences</b>. This institute is a brainwashing center in artificial stress
training whereby participants suddenly find themselves immersed in defending
themselves against vicious accusations. NTL takes in the National Education
Association, the largest teacher group in the United States. While officially
decrying "racism", it is interesting to note that NTL, working with NEA,
produced a paper proposing education vouchers which would separate the
hard-to-teach children from the brighter ones, and funding would be allocated
according to the number of difficult children who would be separated from
those who progressed at a normal rate. The proposal was not taken up.
</p><p><b>University of Pennsylvania, Wharton School of Finance &amp; Commerce</b>
Founded by Eric Trist One of the "brain trusts" of Tavistock, Wharton has
become one of the more important Tavistock in so far as "Behavioral Research"
is concerned. Wharton attracts clients such as the U.S. Department of Labor---which
teaches how to produce "cooked" statistics at the Wharton Econometric Forecasting
Associates Incorporated. This method was very much in demand as we came
to the close of 1991 with millions more out of work than was reflected
in USDL statistics. Wharton's ECONOMETRIC MODELING is used by every major
Committee of 300 company in the United States, Western Europe, the International
Monetary Fund, the United Nations, and the World Bank. Institute for Social
Research Among its clients are The Ford Foundation, U.S.Department of Defense,
U.S.Postal Service and the U.S. Department of Justice. Among its studies
are "The Human Meaning Of Social Change", "Youth in Transition" and "How
Americans View Their Mental Health".
</p><p><b>Institute For The Future</b> This is not a typical Tavistock institution
in that it is funded by the Ford Foundation, yet it draws its long-range
forecasting from the mother of all think tanks. Institute for the Future
projects what it believes to be changes that will be taking place in time
frames of fifty years. So called "DELPHI PANELS" decide what is normal
and what is not, and prepare position papers to "steer" government in the
right direction to head off such groups as "people creating civil disorder."
(This could be patriotic groups demanding abolition of graduated taxes,
or demanding that their right to bear arms is not infringed.) This institute
recommends action such as liberalizing abortion laws, drug usage and that
cars entering an urban area pay tolls, teaching birth control in public
schools, requiring registration of firearms, making use of drugs a non-criminal
offense, legalizing homosexuality, paying students for scholastic achievements,
making zoning controls a preserve of the state, offering bonuses for family
planning and last, but most frightening, a Pol Pot Cambodia-style proposal
that new communities be established in rural areas, (concentration camp
compounds). As can be observed, many of their goals have already been more
than fully realized.
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p><b>INSTITUTE FOR POLICY STUDIES (IPS)</b>
</p><p>One of the "Big Three", IPS has shaped and reshaped United States policies,
foreign and domestic, since it was founded by James P. Warburg and the
Rothschild entities in the United States. Its networks in America include
the League for Industrial Democracy. Lead players in the League for Industrial
Democracy have included Jeane Kirkpatrick, former U.S. Ambassador to the
United Nations, Irwin Suall of the ADL, Eugene Rostow, Arms control negotiator,
Lane Kirkland, Labor Leader, and Albert Shanker. IPS was incorporated in
1963 by Marcus Raskin and Richard Barnett, both highly trained Tavistock
Institute graduates. The objectives of IPS came from an agenda laid down
for it by the Tavistock Institute, one of the most notable being to create
the "New Left" as a grass roots movement in the U.S. Its been said that
Barnett and Raskin controlled such diverse elements as the Black Panthers,
Daniel Ellsberg, National Security Council staff member Halprin, The Weathermen
Underground, the Venceramos and the campaign staff of candidate George
McGovern. No scheme was too big for IFS and its controllers to take on
and manage.
</p><p>Through its many powerful lobbing groups on Capitol Hill, IPS relentlessly
used its "Big Stick" to beat Congress. IPS has a network of lobbyists,
all supposedly operating independently but in actual fact acting cohesively,
so that Congressmen are pummeled from all sides by seemingly different
and varied lobbyists, In this way, IPS was, and is still, able to successfully
sway individual Representatives and Senators to vote for "the trend, the
way things are going." By using key pointmen on Capitol Hill, IPS was able
to break into the very infrastructure of our legislative system and the
way it works.
</p><p>IPS became, and remains to this day, one of the most prestigious "think
tanks" controlling foreign policy decisions, which we, the people, foolishly
believe are those of our law makers. By sponsoring militant activism at
home and with links to revolutionaries abroad, by engineering such victories
as "The Pentagon Papers," besieging the corporate structure, bridging the
credibility gap between underground movements and acceptable political
activism, by penetrating religious organizations and using them to sow
discord in America, such as radical racial policies under the guise of
religion, using establishment media to spread IPS ideas, and then supporting
them, IPS has lived up to the role which it was founded to play.

House: "Grants (for the IPS) came from the Samuel Rubin Foundation and
the Stern Family Fund. <b>Samuel Rubin</b> was himself a member of the
elite Comintern of the Communist Party, founded by none other than Lenin
himself. Billionaire <b>Armand Hammer</b> assisted Rubin in making the
fortunes which helped launch IPS. <b>Philip Stern</b>, an IPS trustee,
was the president of Stern Fund. The executive director of the Stern Fund,
<b>David R. Hunter</b>, was previously an official of <b>The National Council
and the World Council Of Churches. (</b>Dr. James W. Wardner, <i>Unholy
Alliances</i>, p.125)]
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p><b>STANFORD RESEARCH INSTITUTE</b>
</p><p>Jesse Hobson, the first president of Stanford Research Institute, in
a 1952 speech made it clear what lines the institute was to follow. Stanford
can be described as one of the "jewels" in Tavistock's Crown in its rule
over the United States. Founded in 1946 immediately after the close of
WWII, it was presided over by <b>Charles A. Anderson</b>, with emphasis
on mind control research and "future sciences." Included under the Stanford
umbrella was <b>Charles F. Kettering Foundation</b> which developed the
"Changing Images of Man" upon which the Aquarian Conspiracy rests.
</p><p>Some of Stanford's major clients and contracts were at first centered
around the defense establishment but, as Stanford grew, so, did the diversity
of its services:
</p><p>Applications of Behavioral Sciences to Research Management Office of
Science and Technology
</p><p>SRI Business Intelligence Program
</p><p>U.S. Department of Defense Directorate of Defense Research and Engineering
</p><p>U.S. Department of Defense Office of Aerospace Research
</p><p>Among corporations seeking Stanford's services were Wells Fargo Bank,
Bechtel Corporation, Hewlett Packard, Bank of America, McDonnell Douglas
Corporation, Blyth, Eastman Dillon and TRW Company. <i>One of Stanford's
more secret projects was extensive work on chemical and bacteriological
warfare (CAB) weapons.</i>
</p><p>Stanford Research is plugged into at least 200 smaller "think tanks"
doing research into every facet of life in America. This is ARPA networking
and represents the emergence of probably the most far reaching effort to
control the environment of every individual in the country. At present
Stanford's computers are linked with 2500 "sister" research consoles which
include the CIA, Bell Telephone Laboratories, U.S. Army Intelligence, The
Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI), Rand, MIT, Harvard and UCLA. Stanford
plays a key role in that it is the "library", cataloging all ARPA documentation.
</p><p>"Other agencies".....one can use one's imagination here, are allowed
to search through SRI's "library" for key words, phrases, look through
sources and update their own master files with those of Stanford Research
Center. The Pentagon uses SRI's master files extensively, and there is
little doubt that other U.S. Government agencies do the same. Pentagon
"command and control" problems are worked out by Stanford.
</p><p>While ostensibly these apply only to weapons and soldiers, there is
absolutely no guarantee that the same research could not , and will not
be turned to civilian applications. Stanford is known to be willing to
do anything for anyone.
</p><p>[Editor, Tim Aho: See Watch Unto Prayer report &lt;http://watch.pair.com/dolphin.html&gt;Lambert

Lambert Dolphin with the Edgar Cayce Foundation and The Discernment Ministries.]
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p><b>MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY (MIT),</b>
<br><b>ALFRED P. SLOAN SCHOOL OF MANAGEMENT</b>
</p><p>This major institute is not generally recognized as being a part of
Tavistock U.S.A. Most people look upon it as being a purely American institution,
but that is far from the truth. MIT- Alfred Sloan can be roughly divided
into the following groups:
</p><p>Contemporary Technology Industrial Relations NASA-ERC Computer Research
Laboratories Office of Naval Research Group, Psychology Systems Dynamics
</p><p>Some of MIT's clients are:
</p><p>American Management Association
<br>Committee for Economic Development
<br>GTE
<br>Institute for Defense Analysis (IDA)
<br>NASA
<br>National Academy of Sciences
<br>National Council of Churches
<br>Sylvania
<br>TRW
<br>U.S. Army
<br>U.S. Department of State
<br>U.S. Navy
<br>U.S. Treasury
<br>Volkswagen Company
<br>&nbsp;
</p><p><b>RAND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION</b>
</p><p>Without a doubt, RAND is THE think tank most beholden to Tavistock Institute
and certainly the RIIA's most prestigious vehicle for control of United
States policies at every level. Specific RAND policies that became operative
include our ICBM program, prime analyses for U.S. foreign policy making,
instigator of space programs, U.S. nuclear policies, corporate analyses,
hundreds of projects for the military, the Central Intelligence Agency
(CIA) in relation to the use of mind altering drugs like peyote, LSD (the
covert MK-ULTRA operation which lasted for 20 years).
</p><p>[Editor, Tim Aho's note: The founder of the Rand Corporation, <b>Herman
Kahn</b>, also founded the Hudson Institute in 1961. In Educating for the
New World Order, B.K. Eakman tells of a training manual for "change agents"
developed for the U.S. government by Rand Corporation: ". . . a how-to
manual with a 1971 U.S. Office of Education contract number on it entitled
'Training for Change Agents'; seven volumes of 'change agent studies' commissioned
by the U.S. Office of Education to the Rand Corporation in 1973-74; scores
of other papers submitted by behaviorist researchers who had obtained grants
from the U.S. Office of Education for the purpose of exploring ways to
'freeze' and 'unfreeze' values, 'to implement change,' and to turn potentially
hostile groups and committees into acquiescent, rubber-stamp bodies by
means of such strategies as the 'Delphi Technique.'" (p. 118)]
</p><p>Some of RAND's clients include:
</p><p>American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&amp;T)
<br>Chase Manhattan Bank
<br>International Business Machines (IBM)
<br>National Science Foundation
<br>Republican Party
<br>TRW
<br>U.S. Air Force
<br>U.S. Department of Health
<br>U.S. Department of Energy
</p><p>There are literally THOUSANDS of highly important companies, government
institutions and organizations that make use of RANDS's services. To list
them all would be impossible. Among RAND's specialities is a study group
that predicts the timing and the direction of a thermonuclear war, plus
working out the many scenarios based upon its findings. RAND was once accused
of being commissioned by the USSR to work out terms of surrender of the
United States Government, an accusation that went all the way to the United
States Senate, where it was taken up by Senator Symington and subsequently
fell victim to scorn poured out by the establishment press. BRAINWASHING
remains the primary function of RAND.
</p><p>These institutions are among those that fund The UNIFORM LAW FOUNDATION,
whose function is to ensure that the <b>Uniform Commercial Code </b>remains
the instrument for conducting business in the United States.</p></blockquote>
