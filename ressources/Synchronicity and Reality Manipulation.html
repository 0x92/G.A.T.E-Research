			First order beings must obey the laws of physics, but can break the

			They are derived from zero order beings. They are holographic images 
			of their Creator and exist in a physical reality designed, 
			constructed, and maintained by that zero order being. <br>
			<br>
			First order beings are holographic replicas of the zero order being, 
			though reduced in potential because they are bound to the rules set 
			up by the zero order being. In other words, the zero order being 
			creates a physical reality out of SOLIDIFIED holographic images of 
			itself, then infuses matter in that reality with CONSCIOUS 
			holographic fragments of itself.<br>
			<br>
			This is analogous to a computer programmer writing a video game, 
			then playing it by 'becoming' a character within. The game character 
			is figuratively a holographic image of the player, since it does 
			everything the player does with his keyboard or joystick. However, 
			the character is limited by the rules of the game. For example, the 
			player can get up and grab a sandwich, but the character cannot, 
			unless that is programmed in the game. </font></p>

			potential; while the player can start a business, grow old, and 
			travel the world, all the character can do is operate within the 
			various levels of the game. <br>
			<br>
			Likewise, first order beings, despite being holographic images of 
			the powerful zero order being, are limited in what they can do. They 
			cannot themselves, for example, break the laws of physics, for the 
			laws of physics are the physical rules of the game designed by the 
			zeroth order being. <br>
			<br>
			Because first order beings are derivatives of the zero order being, 
			they have special communication privileges with it. As will be 
			explained soon, emotion is a medium of this communication. By 
			communicating with the zero order being, first order beings can 
			indirectly influence the laws of probability and hence create 
			synchronicity by causing certain laws of physics pertaining to time 
			travel to be broken by the zero order being. <br>
			<br>
			In our analogy, this would be equivalent to a game character 
			communicating with the programmer, who then changes the code in 
			accordance with the character's wishes. <br>

					<font face="Arial" size="2">Giving this thought-form&nbsp; attention and

			Emotion 
			is energy, and energy without order is useless, which can be seen in 
			thermodynamic systems where great disorder, or entropy, means little 
			useful energy available for work. <br>
			<br>
			Like energy, emotion is quite generic and can be used by anyone with 
			the means to direct it, even someone from whom the emotion did not 
			originate. It can thus be siphoned, collected, and redirected to 
			accomplish first order effects. Since second order beings are 
			incapable of generating these emotions to begin with, to achieve 
			first order effects they must tap emotion from first order beings. 
			Thus, second order beings comprise the majority of those who steal 
			emotions.<br>
			<br>
			But an emotion also comes with a signature of its originator. This 
			signature can be likened to a non-Hertzian (nonlinear, chaotic, 
			unpredictable) frequency where the shape of the wave is what makes 
			the signature unique. Despite these signatures being non-Hertzian, 
			they still resonate with the original source, since both 'vibrate' 
			with similar nonlinear, chaotic, and seemingly unpredictable 
			characteristics. Therefore, it is most effective to alter the past 
			by using emotion to manipulate the past version of its source.<br>
			<br>
			Using emotions from one person to manipulate another is possible, 
			but the process is not as efficient since there is a mismatch in 
			signature. Energy, for example, is most easily transferred from one 
			tuning fork to another if both have <i>the same resonance frequency</i>.
			<br>
			<br>
			Raw emotions, like raw energy, can accomplish tasks in a brute force 
			manner. But when information is added, the effectiveness 
			dramatically increases. For example, 10 joules of energy put into 
			opening a closed door by means of a battering ram will work, but .5 
			joules used to turn the doorknob will also. The second is more 
			complicated and subtle, but in the end accomplishes the same goal.

			<br>
			To cause synchronicity in the present, emotion is used as a carrier 
			wave upon which information is sent back in time to appropriate 
			persons with the leverage to create the desired future 
			synchronicity. These person's actions are altered and biased such 
			that later, the consequences of their actions come together in the 
			synchronicity.<br>
			<br>
			How exactly are their actions altered? Either by further 
			synchronicities, subliminal telepathic suggestions, or raw emotions.<br>
			<br>
			In the case of synchronicities, they make a choice they would 
			otherwise not have made because this time around, they notice 
			something so unbelievably coincidental that they freely act upon 
			that event simply as a superstitious measure. <br>
			<br>
			With subliminal telepathic suggestions, a thought they normally 
			would have had is suppressed, they feel inspired by a new thought, or 
			they are pressed to commit a particular action at a different time 
			than usual. <br>
			<br>
			For raw emotion, the carrier wave itself is honed in upon them 
			(probably by treating the original emotion 
			<a target="_blank" href="http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/salud/esp_salud19.htm">
			<font color="#0000DD">radionically</font></a> with the 
			target's signature if the source of the emotion is not the target), 
			which clouds their mind and drives them out of impulse into making 
			altered decisions. <br>

			with a host of negative emotions such as self-hatred, blame, 
			vengeance, and greed, you in effect start a feedback cycle whereby

			<br>
			The <i>biggest fallacy in New Age thinking</i> is that <i>there are no

			simple proposed solution, then, is to unattract bad experience by 
			doing some reality creation via focused emotion.<br>
			<br>
			Some people make the mistake of thinking that since freewill cannot 
			be violated, if one chooses to be a 'servant of light' or filled 
			with 'love and light' that they are protected from negative forces. 
			Well, they may be protected from negative synchronicity, but not 
			from physical force. It doesn't mean that they can't be harmed at 
			all, it simply means that they can't be harmed without karmic 
			repercussions for the perpetrator. </font></p>

			In the first case, emotion is merely a crowbar that cracks open a

			timeline does not bifurcate or branch. It is merely the emotion 
			which travels back in time, which is allowed since it is a zero 
			order force). <br>
			<br>
			In the case of a zero order being, reality itself can be

			This is a powerful tool and weapon, a threat against second

			of having their choices altered by first order beings who request 
			<i>God</i> to do so.<br>
			<br>
			Second order beings, dissatisfied with this situation, have found 
			one way of <i>hacking into</i> <i>God</i> in order to accomplish the same. Since 
			first order beings are intimately related to <i>God</i>, there is a direct 
			symbolic and holographic coupling between their internal mental

			world is to a first order being as physical reality is to a zero

			So what do second order beings do, since their internal mental

			<br>
			If you are privileged, negative events occur, or you are mistakenly 
			lead to believe an event is negative, from which you learn a lesson

			responsible for these.<br>
			<br>
			If, however, your lesson is minimal and impacts on your life are

			assured that the bad synchronicity occurring was engineered by 
			negative beings. Negative beings can also create synchronicities in 
			your life that appear beneficial, but actually detract you a path
